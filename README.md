# Data-Map
A Data-Map Programmed By Tawfeeq Abdul Gaffoor, and Driven By AmCharts/Maps.



The files required to run this are the "dataparser.py", "main.html", "countryinfo.csv", as well as the amchart/maps files
The python script parses the CSV file and makes the data information, and the main uses the data to display it all 
interactively using JavaScript.
