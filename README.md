A Data-Map Programmed By Tawfeeq Abdul Gaffoor, and Driven By AmCharts/Maps.

**Languages:**
Python 2.7.10 (WILL NOT RUN with Pyhon 3.x)  
JavaScript

CSS  

**How to Run/Setup:**

If you wish to simply view the final product, head over to : t3abdulg.github.io/Data-Map

However, if you wish to see the full project in action:  

1) Download  
        "dataparser.py"   
        "index.html"  
        "countryinfo.csv"  
        "amcharts" (folder)  
        "ammaps" (folder)  

2) Place them all in the same folder, and run "dataparser.py"

3) Open "index.html"

NOTE: The "dataparser.py" is a script that is intended to be run once, as it generates files. If it is run once, do NOT run it again. If for some reason you must. Delete all the created data.js files, and run again. (This will be fixed soon)
